# VACCINE AVAILABILITY CHECKER

## Introduction

It is avaccine availibility checker scout program that initially takes inputs(from terminal itself) from the user about their state, district, age group(above 45 years / 18 to 45 years) and date on which the user wants to check the availability of vaccination slots/sessions in thier area, and accordingly displays the output of the vaccination centers and their vaccination slots available for them on that date. The user can also check for a particular center in his/her area.The good thing is user needs to input the details only once and then the program itself keeps checking the availibilty every minute and notifies(using beeps and changing color of the logs in the terminal) the user if slots for the vaccination are available according to their inputs.

I have used the cowin api for the checking of vaccine slots.
